# tktreectrl

**NOTE: this repository is obsolete. The tktreectrl port to Tcl/Tk 9 is at https://github.com/tcltk-depot/tktreectrl/tree/master**

This is a fork of the original tktreectrl project at http://tktreectrl.sf.net/.

The modifications in this fork are

* Addition of nmake/Visual C++ makefiles in the win directory

* Bugfix for a performance issue when table cells contain even moderately large amount of text

Please see the original website above for documentation, examples, demos etc. This fork adds no new functionality.
